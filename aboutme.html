<p>Hello! My name is Joaquim Monteiro, i'm 18 years old and i'm from Pawtucket, Rhode Island. I like most things but my hobbies are video games and going outside playing sports and things of that nature. I have no previous computer science experience so it really interests me learning things about this course! I chose URI as the college I wanted to go too because of things like the TD program, and my parents they really liked the school but it was mostly my decision I fell in love with the school!</p></h1>
